# weather-app

This project is a simple weather forecast app.

The guidelines for this project are from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) as part of the lesson [Project: Weather App](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app).

## To-do

The app was originally built with WeatherAPI on a free trial, which is now limited to a 3 day forecast. Need to refactor using another API for a full forecast.
